Project aether knight is a fantasy first person multiplayer class based extraction puzzler. In PAK (Project Aether Knight) you play as a construct given the task of retrieving McGuffins and gold from areas dangerously full of aether. Aether is magic essence that has mad regions dangerous for humans so the constructs are sent out instead. As you arrive to the mission, the area is mostly cleared of aether and you begin exploring the map. Then as time progresses the map begins to fill back up with aether and become dangerous again. So in order to leave with the most valuables you must plan and work together leveraging class differences to solve ancient puzzles and gather as many resources.

## Game Play Loop:

- **Scout**: Explore the map and discover both valuables locations and dangerous locations, gather information

-  **Plan**: Figure out what locations are good targets who should manage what and how you plan to leave

- **Extract**: Execute the plan, solve puzzles to obtain valuables and begin moving them to the extraction point

- **Leave**: the longer you stay the more dangerous and more quickly it becomes dangerous so you must have an escape plan and if done too late you will lose players. if done too early you are missing out on valuables.

*\*Players must take a significant amount of time to move and/or obtain valuables so that planning and scouting are necessary to obtain a decent amount of valuables*
